# dog-breed-classifier

The aim of the project is to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. The algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed given an image. When the image is of a human, the algorithm will choose an estimate of a dog breed that resembles the human. If neither a dog or a human is detected, then an error message is output. Therefore, the models in place should be capable of detecting a dog or human in an image, classify the dog to its breed and classify a dog breed that the human resembles.
